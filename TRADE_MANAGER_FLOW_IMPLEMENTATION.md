# Trade Manager Flow Implementation

## Please Explain:

1. **Account Setup Flow**:
   - User enters username/password
   - User checks "TradingView add-on enabled"?
   - What happens next? How do we verify TradingView connection?

2. **TradingView Connection**:
   - How do we connect to TradingView's broker integration API?
   - What's the API endpoint/URL?
   - How do we authenticate? (username/password? API key? token?)

3. **Market Data Access**:
   - What TradingView API endpoints give us market data?
   - REST API or WebSocket?
   - How do we subscribe to real-time prices?

4. **Order Execution**:
   - Do we place orders through TradingView or directly to Tradovate?
   - If through TradingView, what's the endpoint?
   - If directly to Tradovate, how do we get auth token from username/password?

5. **Any API Documentation**:
   - Have you seen any TradingView broker integration API docs?
   - Any examples or code snippets?
