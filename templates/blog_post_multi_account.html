    <h2>What Is Multi-Account Trading?</h2>
    <p>Multi-account trading is simple in concept: You run the same strategy across multiple accounts simultaneously, all trading the same signals with consistent execution.</p>
    <p>Think of it this way. You have one trading strategy. Instead of trading it on one account, you trade it on three. Or five. Or ten.</p>
    <p>Why would you do this? Because you want to scale your profitability without changing your strategy.</p>
    <p>If your strategy makes $500/day on one account, why not make $1,500 on three accounts? Or $5,000 on ten?</p>
    <p>The math is elegant. The execution is chaotic (without automation).</p>
  </section>

  <section class="post-section">
    <h2>The Prop Firm Dimension</h2>
    <p>Multi-account trading becomes especially attractive when you're trading funded accounts through prop firms.</p>
    <p>Here's how prop firm scaling typically works:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Challenge Phase:</strong> You get 1 funded account ($25K or $50K). Your job: hit the profit target (usually 5-10% of account balance).</li>
      <li><strong>Profit Target Hit:</strong> Congratulations. Now you can scale to 2-3 more accounts.</li>
      <li><strong>Consistent Profits:</strong> Show consistent monthly profits and you can scale to 5-10 accounts. Some firms allow 20+.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The money math gets interesting here:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1 account @ $50K + 1% per day average:</strong> $500/day × 20 trading days = $10,000/month</li>
      <li><strong>5 accounts @ $50K + 1% per day average:</strong> $2,500/day × 20 trading days = $50,000/month</li>
      <li><strong>10 accounts @ $50K + 1% per day average:</strong> $5,000/day × 20 trading days = $100,000/month</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Obviously, this assumes your strategy maintains a consistent 1% daily return across all accounts, which is the hard part. But you get the concept. Scale your accounts, scale your profits. Linearly.</p>
    <p>The catch? You need to execute consistently across all accounts. That's where multi-account trading gets complicated.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="post-section">
    <h2>Why It Gets Complicated (And Why It Matters)</h2>

    <h3>The Manual Execution Problem</h3>
    <p>Let's say you're trading NQ (E-mini Nasdaq). Your strategy fires a signal: "BUY 1 NQ at market, target +200 ticks, stop 50 ticks."</p>
    <p>You have 3 accounts. Manually:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Switch to Account 1 → BUY 1 NQ → execute at 5,230.50</li>
      <li>Switch to Account 2 → BUY 1 NQ → execute at 5,230.75 (price moved 0.25 while you were switching)</li>
      <li>Switch to Account 3 → BUY 1 NQ → execute at 5,231.00 (price moved another 0.25)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Three accounts. Same signal. Three different entry prices. That's slippage. That costs money.</p>
    <p>Now scale to 5 accounts. Or 10. Suddenly each account has a different entry price, a different P&L, a different feel. Your 1% per day on one account becomes 0.7% on average across ten accounts because of this slippage.</p>

    <h3>The Consistency Problem</h3>
    <p>Beyond slippage, there's the mental load. Executing ten accounts manually takes 60-90 seconds. During that time, things change:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You get distracted by Account 5's execution and forget to set TP on Account 7</li>
      <li>You accidentally double-click BUY on Account 3, now it has 2 contracts instead of 1</li>
      <li>You're tired, it's the 5th signal of the day, and you make a typo on Account 9's stop loss</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These mistakes cascade. One bad execution on one account means the whole multi-account strategy is off sync.</p>

    <h3>The Risk Management Problem</h3>
    <p>With ten accounts, you now have ten positions to manage independently. What happens if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Account 7's TP fills but Account 3's TP didn't execute due to a technical glitch?</li>
      <li>You want to take profits early on Account 5 but not the others?</li>
      <li>Account 2 hits its daily loss limit but the other nine should keep trading?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Without solid infrastructure, managing ten independent accounts feels like herding cats.</p>

    <h3>The Solution: Automation</h3>
    <p>Automation eliminates all three problems. A webhook-based system:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Executes all ten accounts simultaneously (< 100ms difference)</li>
      <li>No human errors, no typos, no distraction</li>
      <li>Enforces position limits per account, stops trading when loss limits are hit, manages TP/SL independently</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With automation, multi-account scaling becomes elegant instead of chaotic.</p>

    <h2>Three Approaches to Multi-Account Trading</h2>

    <h3>Approach 1: Manual Execution (The Hard Way)</h3>
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> You watch your strategy. A signal fires. You manually execute all accounts yourself.</p>

    <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>No third-party tool required. Just you and your broker.</li>
      <li>No monthly fees.</li>
      <li>Total control. You decide exactly when and how to execute.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Execution inconsistency (different prices per account).</li>
      <li>Mental load scales with account count. 1 account is easy. 5 accounts is doable. 10+ accounts is exhausting.</li>
      <li>Mistakes and typos are inevitable. At scale, you'll cost yourself real money.</li>
      <li>Doesn't scale beyond 3-5 accounts practically.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Starting out with 1-2 accounts. You're learning and not ready to invest in automation yet.</p>

    ---

    <h3>Approach 2: Trade Copier Software (Medium Complexity)</h3>
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> You trade one "master" account. Trade copier software automatically copies your trades to 5-20 "slave" accounts.</p>

    <p><strong>How it's typically done:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You place a trade on Account 1 (the master)</li>
      <li>The copier detects the order and automatically mirrors it to Accounts 2-10</li>
      <li>When Account 1's TP fills, all slaves' TP fill (or get adjusted)</li>
      <li>When Account 1's SL hits, all slaves get flattened</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You only execute one account (less mental load).</li>
      <li>Copies are automatic and simultaneous.</li>
      <li>Good for live manual trading (not just automated alerts).</li>
      <li>Position sizes can be scaled per account (e.g., half-size on Account 5).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Depends on the master account. If you make a mistake on the master, all slaves inherit it.</li>
      <li>TP/SL management is tricky. If the master's TP is at +200 ticks but Account 3 entered 3 ticks lower, does the +200 still apply?</li>
      <li>Requires trade-by-trade detection logic. Tends to fail with complex bracket orders.</li>
      <li>Lag time between master execution and copy execution (usually 1-5 seconds).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Live manual traders who want to copy their own trades to other accounts. Not ideal for algorithmic/TradingView strategies.</p>

    ---

    <h3>Approach 3: Webhook-Based Automation (Scalable and Elegant)</h3>
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Your TradingView strategy sends a signal to a webhook URL. The automation platform decodes the signal and simultaneously executes on all connected accounts.</p>

    <p><strong>Flow:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>TradingView alert fires (BUY 1 NQ, +200 ticks TP, 50 tick SL)</li>
      <li>Alert message sent via webhook to your automation platform</li>
      <li>Platform decodes the message in real time</li>
      <li>In < 100ms, orders placed on all connected accounts simultaneously</li>
      <li>Platform automatically manages TP/SL placement, position reconciliation, and risk controls</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>True simultaneous execution (all accounts at the same price).</li>
      <li>Scales to any number of accounts (1-20+) with zero added complexity.</li>
      <li>Automates risk management (max loss cutoffs, TP placement, SL management).</li>
      <li>Decouples human from execution (fewer mistakes).</li>
      <li>Works with any systematic strategy (TradingView Pine Script, other platforms).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Requires setting up webhooks (not hard, but not point-and-click).</li>
      <li>Monthly cost for the platform (typically $100-$300/mo).</li>
      <li>If the platform goes down, you don't execute. (Rare with good platforms, but a risk.)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Traders scaling to 3+ accounts seriously. This is the pro setup.</p>

    <h2>Risk Management for Multi-Account Traders</h2>

    <h3>Rule 1: Independent Account Limits</h3>
    <p>Each account should have its own daily loss limit. If Account 1 hits -$1,500 loss for the day, Account 1 stops trading. Accounts 2-10 keep going.</p>
    <p>Why? Account 1 might be having an off day due to slippage or bad signal quality. You don't want to shut down ALL your accounts just because one had a bad day.</p>
    <p><strong>How to set it:</strong> In your automation platform, set max daily loss per account. Most platforms support this natively.</p>

    <h3>Rule 2: Position Sizing by Account Risk Appetite</h3>
    <p>Not all accounts need to be equal. You can set different multipliers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account 1:</strong> 1x position size (default)</li>
      <li><strong>Account 2:</strong> 1x position size (default)</li>
      <li><strong>Account 3:</strong> 2x position size (aggressive, more capital)</li>
      <li><strong>Account 4:</strong> 0.5x position size (conservative, smaller account)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This way, your scaling is intentional, not automatic. You control the risk profile of each account.</p>

    <h3>Rule 3: Correlated Risk Management</h3>
    <p>All your accounts are trading the same signal. If the signal is wrong, they all lose simultaneously. You're not hedging risk by having multiple accounts—you're amplifying it.</p>
    <p>Protect against this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Diversify signal sources:</strong> Don't run 10 accounts all on the exact same TradingView strategy. Have 5 on Strategy A and 5 on Strategy B.</li>
      <li><strong>Trade different symbols:</strong> Have some accounts on NQ, some on ES, some on GC. If NQ has a bad day, GC might be strong.</li>
      <li><strong>Vary entry times:</strong> If all accounts enter at the same time on the same signal, they all exit at roughly the same time. Stagger entries by 30-60 seconds on a few accounts to reduce correlation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rule 4: Infrastructure Redundancy</h3>
    <p>If your automation platform goes down, you don't execute. That's fine for a 30-minute outage during low-vol hours. That's a disaster if it happens during market open.</p>
    <p>Hedge this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use a reliable platform:</strong> Don't use a solo developer's side project. Use a platform with 99%+ uptime records.</li>
      <li><strong>Have a manual fallback:</strong> Know how to manually execute your 3 most important accounts if the platform goes down.</li>
      <li><strong>Monitor actively the first month:</strong> After scaling to 5+ accounts, monitor the platform logs closely the first 20-30 trades. Make sure it's working as expected before you go silent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9-Step Technical Setup Walkthrough</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Choose Your Strategy</h3>
    <p>Pick one trading strategy. This is your core algorithm. It should work on one account before you scale it to ten.</p>
    <p>Document it clearly: entry conditions, exit conditions, TP distance, SL distance, any filters (time-of-day, volatility, etc.).</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Build/Validate in Pine Script</h3>
    <p>Code it in TradingView Pine Script. Backtest it thoroughly. Know your expected win rate, average winner, average loser, and Sharpe ratio.</p>
    <p>This is non-negotiable. If your strategy doesn't work in backtesting, it won't work live on 10 accounts.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Set Up an Automation Platform</h3>
    <p>Create an account with a multi-account automation platform (Just.Trades, TradersPost, AlertDragon, etc.). You'll get a webhook URL for your strategy.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Connect Your Broker Accounts</h3>
    <p>Link each of your trading accounts to the platform via OAuth or API key. Usually takes 5 minutes per account.</p>
    <p>Start with 1-2 accounts. Add more as you gain confidence.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Create a Recorder/Strategy Configuration</h3>
    <p>In your platform, set up a "recorder" or "strategy config" with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Symbol (NQ, ES, GC, etc.)</li>
      <li>Default position size</li>
      <li>Default TP distance and trim</li>
      <li>Default SL distance</li>
      <li>Risk management rules (max loss, daily cutoff times, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 6: Link Accounts to Your Strategy</h3>
    <p>Create a "trader" entry for each account. Set multipliers, overrides, and enable/disable flags.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Account 1: 1x multiplier, enabled</li>
      <li>Account 2: 1x multiplier, enabled</li>
      <li>Account 3: 2x multiplier, enabled (aggressive)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 7: Build Your Alert Message</h3>
    <p>In TradingView Pine Script, create an alert that outputs JSON with your signal details.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre><code>{
  "action": "{{strategy.order.action}}",
  "ticker": "{{ticker}}",
  "contracts": {{strategy.order.contracts}},
  "tp_ticks": 200,
  "sl_ticks": 50
}</code></pre>

    <h3>Step 8: Create the Alert in TradingView</h3>
    <p>Right-click your strategy → Add Alert → paste your webhook URL in the Webhook URL field → paste your alert message template in the Message field.</p>
    <p>Set to "Once per bar close."</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Test with Small Sizes</h3>
    <p>Let 5-10 real signals execute with 1 contract per account. Check:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All accounts execute at roughly the same time</li>
      <li>All accounts have the same entry price (within 1-2 ticks)</li>
      <li>TP/SL are placed correctly</li>
      <li>Closes are handled properly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If everything looks good, scale to 2-3 contracts per account and monitor for another 10-15 trades. Then go to full size.</p>

    <h2>6 Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)</h2>

    <h3>Mistake 1: Scaling Without Validation</h3>
    <p><strong>What happens:</strong> You create 10 accounts, set everything up, hit play... and realize your strategy has a critical flaw you didn't catch in backtesting. Now you're losing 10x faster.</p>
    <p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Validate on 1 account first. Run 20-30 real trades. Only then scale to 3-5 accounts. Scale again to 10 after another 50 trades.</p>

    <h3>Mistake 2: Not Managing Broker Token Expiration</h3>
    <p><strong>What happens:</strong> Your broker API tokens expire (Apex tokens expire every 90 min). Your automation platform doesn't refresh them. Suddenly, Account 7 stops executing. You don't notice until hours later.</p>
    <p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Set up token refresh in your platform (most do this automatically). Monitor your platform's logs daily. If you see auth errors, re-authenticate immediately.</p>

    <h3>Mistake 3: Mixing Different Strategies on the Same Account Set</h3>
    <p><strong>What happens:</strong> You have Strategy A running on 5 accounts and Strategy B running on the same 5 accounts. Now an account might be long due to Strategy A while Strategy B is trying to short. Position management chaos.</p>
    <p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> One account, one strategy. If you want to run multiple strategies, use separate account sets for each.</p>

    <h3>Mistake 4: Not Having Independent Position Limits</h3>
    <p><strong>What happens:</strong> One account has a terrible day and hits -$3,000 loss. But you forgot to set a per-account loss limit, so it keeps trading. By the time you notice, it's -$5,000.</p>
    <p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Set max daily loss per account in your platform. Enforce it strictly.</p>

    <h3>Mistake 5: Assuming All Accounts Will Have the Same P&L</h3>
    <p><strong>What happens:</strong> You expect all 10 accounts to make 1% per day, totaling 10% daily across all accounts. Instead, they make 0.8% per day on average due to slippage, fees, and signal variance. You're not scaling linearly.</p>
    <p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Expect 0.7-0.9x the single-account performance per additional account. Build a conservative scaling model. If one account makes 1%, assume 5 accounts make 4.5% total (0.9% per account). Be pleasantly surprised if you do better.</p>

    <h3>Mistake 6: Going Live on Too Many Accounts Too Fast</h3>
    <p><strong>What happens:</strong> You set up 10 accounts, run 2 signals to test, everything looks good. So you go full size on all 10. Third signal has a weird price spike, one account gets filled wrong, chaos. You don't know what happened because you moved so fast.</p>
    <p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Slow down. Start with 2 accounts. Run 20+ signals. Move to 5 accounts. Run 50+ signals. Then scale to 10+. Each step should take 1-3 weeks minimum.</p>

  <section class="post-section">
    <h2>The Scaling Flywheel</h2>

    <p>Multi-account trading isn't just about executing trades on more accounts. It's about building a sustainable scaling system.</p>

    <h3>The Flywheel Cycle:</h3>

    <p><strong>1. Build: Create one tested strategy</strong></p>
    <p>Spend 4-8 weeks building and validating your strategy on one live account. Track daily P&L, win rate, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Prove: Hit 6-8 weeks of consistent profitability</strong></p>
    <p>Before scaling, prove your edge on one account. If you can't make money on one account, you won't make money on ten.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Scale: Add 2-3 more accounts</strong></p>
    <p>Now run your proven strategy on 3 accounts. Monitor for another 6-8 weeks. If P&L is consistent (80%+ of single-account performance), you're ready to scale further.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Automate: Invest in automation infrastructure</strong></p>
    <p>At 3 accounts, manual execution is still feasible. At 5+ accounts, automation becomes essential. This is when you invest in a platform like Just.Trades.</p>

    <p><strong>5. Optimize: Refine execution, reduce slippage</strong></p>
    <p>With automation in place, focus on optimization. Are there ways to reduce slippage? Can you improve TP/SL placement? Can you detect and avoid low-liquidity times?</p>

    <p><strong>6. Scale Again: Add more accounts based on capital available</strong></p>
    <p>Once you've optimized execution, you can confidently scale to 5, 10, even 20 accounts. Each cycle takes 8-12 weeks.</p>

    <h3>Timeline:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Weeks 1-8:</strong> Build & prove on 1 account</li>
      <li><strong>Weeks 9-16:</strong> Scale to 3 accounts, validate consistency</li>
      <li><strong>Weeks 17-24:</strong> Set up automation, scale to 5-7 accounts</li>
      <li><strong>Weeks 25-36:</strong> Optimize execution, scale to 10+ accounts</li>
      <li><strong>Months 9+:</strong> Sustain and grow</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is not a 30-day sprint. This is a 9-12 month journey from one account to ten. Anyone promising faster scaling is selling something.</p>

    <h2>Real Scenarios: What Actually Happens</h2>

    <h3>Scenario 1: Your Strategy Works, But Slippage Kills Profits</h3>
    <p><strong>The situation:</strong> You have 5 accounts. Your strategy is right directionally, but by the time you execute all 5 accounts manually, you've lost 10-15 ticks to slippage. That wipes out half your profit.</p>
    <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Automate with a webhook platform. All 5 accounts execute within 100ms at the same price. Slippage drops to 1-2 ticks. Profits jump 50%+.</p>

    <h3>Scenario 2: One Account Has a Drawdown, You Panic and Scale Down</h3>
    <p><strong>The situation:</strong> Account 3 has a -$2,000 losing day. You panic, assume your strategy is broken, and reduce position sizes across all 10 accounts. Then the next 3 signals are winners and you realize the drawdown was just variance.</p>
    <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Set position size rules upfront. Stick to them. Don't react to short-term variance. If you planned 10 accounts at 1 contract each, keep executing 10 accounts at 1 contract each for at least 4 weeks. Only adjust after 20+ signals.</p>

    <h3>Scenario 3: Your Broker's Platform Goes Down</h3>
    <p><strong>The situation:</strong> Apex (or your broker) has a server issue during market hours. You can't place orders for 15 minutes. During those 15 minutes, your strategy fires 3 signals that miss entirely.</p>
    <p><strong>The fix:</strong> You can't prevent this. But you can:</li>
        <li>Use a reliable broker (Apex, Tradovate are solid).</li>
        <li>Have 1-2 backup accounts on a different broker (in case your primary broker is down).</li>
        <li>Accept that 1-2 missed signals per month is normal. Don't overreact.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Scenario 4: You Accidentally Reduce Position Size on All Accounts</h3>
    <p><strong>The situation:</strong> You meant to scale down Account 5, but you accidentally changed the global position size multiplier. Now all 10 accounts are trading half-size. You don't notice for 4 hours. You've missed out on $4,000 in profit potential.</p>
    <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Use an automation platform that prevents these mistakes. Never manually set individual account sizes if you can automate it. Use multipliers per account, not absolute quantities.</p>

    <h3>Scenario 5: Your Daily Loss Limit Triggers Unexpectedly</h3>
    <p><strong>The situation:</strong> You set a $2,000 daily loss limit per account. By 10 AM, Account 7 has hit -$2,000 and stopped trading. You expected to trade all day, not half-day.</p>
    <p><strong>The fix:</strong> This is working as designed. The loss limit protected you from deeper losses. Don't complain—be glad you had it. Use loss limits to force discipline.</p>

    <h3>Scenario 6: One Signal Conflicts with Your Strategy Rules</h3>
    <p><strong>The situation:</strong> Your strategy fires a SELL signal, but you manually told Account 3 yesterday to "no new shorts." Account 3 doesn't sell. Accounts 1-2 do. Now positions are inconsistent.</p>
    <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Use an automation platform that enforces position rules. If you set "no shorts" on Account 3, the platform won't let the signal override it. Consistency is guaranteed.</p>

    <h2>FAQ: Multi-Account Trading Questions</h2>

    <h3>Q: Can I run the same account on two different platforms?</h3>
    <p>Not recommended. If two platforms are both trying to manage the same account, they'll conflict. Account 1 places a BUY, Account 2 places a SELL on top of it. Chaos. Use one platform per account.</p>

    <h3>Q: What if I want to manually override one account's trades?</h3>
    <p>Good platforms allow this. You can disable a specific "trader" (account) and it won't execute the automated signal. You can then manually execute that account however you want. Keep it simple though—don't get too fancy.</p>

    <h3>Q: Should I trade different symbols on different accounts?</h3>
    <p>Not necessary, but it reduces correlation. If all 10 accounts trade NQ and NQ has a bad day, all 10 lose. If 5 accounts trade NQ and 5 trade ES, you're more diversified. But don't overcomplicate it early on. Start with all accounts trading the same signal.</p>

    <h3>Q: What if the market gaps against me overnight?</h3>
    <p>Your SL protects you. If ES gaps down 20 points overnight and your SL is 50 points, you'll get stopped out at market open (gap-filled). This is the risk of futures. Accept it. Use reasonable SLs, don't be too tight.</p>

    <h3>Q: Can I scale from 1 account to 10 in one day?</h3>
    <p>Technically yes. Practically no. If you do this, you're taking on 10x the risk on day one with zero validation. What could go wrong? Everything. Scaling takes time for a reason. Resist the temptation to go fast.</p>

    <h3>Q: What if my strategy breaks during market hours?</h3>
    <p>Something glitches. A weird price spike causes bad signal generation. Your TradingView indicator goes haywire. What do you do? Disable the strategy immediately. Don't let it keep firing bad signals on 10 accounts. Investigate after hours. Always have a kill switch.</p>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

    <p>Multi-account futures trading is one of the most effective ways to scale a profitable trading strategy. The math is simple: Profitable strategy × 5 accounts = 5x profits.</p>

    <p>But the execution is complex. It requires:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A validated, edge-based strategy</li>
      <li>Proper risk management per account</li>
      <li>Automation infrastructure for consistent execution</li>
      <li>Patience to scale gradually, not all at once</li>
      <li>Discipline to stick to position limits and loss cutoffs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Get these right, and you'll scale from $500/day on one account to $5,000/day on ten. That's the promise of multi-account trading.</p>

    <p>Rush the process, skip validation, or automate sloppily? You'll lose 10x faster than you ever could on one account.</p>

    <p>The choice is yours. But if you're going to scale, do it right.</p>
